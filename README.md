[How to Build a Compound Liquidation Bot](https://blog.baowebdev.com/2019/11/how-to-build-a-compound-liquidation-bot/)

From fresh clone I had to run npm install at the root, and in the /client folder. Then run npm run start in the /client folder.

I also had to increase npm memory limit:
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096

I am running this inside Windows Subsystem for Linux.
